# React + Vite

This project plays an important role in helping me understand frontend development and how modern applications are built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. Through this project, I became more comfortable working with component-based architecture, state management, and many more.

Although this is not a very large-scale project, I have implemented most of the core React concepts such as:

--Functional components

--Props and state

--useEffect and other hooks

--Context API

--Redux Toolkit for global state management

--Reusable UI components


Building this project gave me practical experience and improved my confidence in developing real-world frontend applications.

I enjoy building projects like this because they strengthen my understanding through hands-on practice. You may find the repository simple in size, but it represents consistent learning and implementation of important concepts.

The project has been successfully deployed after completion.
